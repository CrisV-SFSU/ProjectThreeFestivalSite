          Education is <strong>UNDER ATTACK!</strong> With the new White House
          administration seeking to gut American education, we need to
          <strong>FIGHT BACK!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Come fight with us for 3 days at the SF For Education festival,
          starting from June 1st to June 3rd, 2025. Come listen to California
          Faculty Association leaders as they outline what needs to be done and
          how we can help take back our education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Metal legends <strong>Testament,</strong>
          <strong>Judas Priest</strong> and <strong>Metallica</strong> will join
          us and let loose the most powerful sounds known to humankind. You
          won't want to miss it.
        </p>

        <p>
          All ticket sales will be donated directly to the California Faculty
          Association.
