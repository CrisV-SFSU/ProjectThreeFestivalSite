# Project Three: A Social Justice Festival

by Cristian Vasquez

# Project Overview
For this project, I really wanted to focus on creating solidarity between California State faculty and the students. To do so, I created a festival titled "SF For Education" which is a festival aimed at mainly students, that helps bring awareness to the issues that their faculty is facing. This festival is also partnered with the California Faculty Association (CFA) and will feature key speakers from the union. Each day will also feature a live performance from some of the greatest metal bands on earth to allow attendees to just "let it out". 

For the brand itself, I chose a rounded sans-serif typeface that is modified with a warp and a drop shadow to better push the idea of being bold, loud, and active. The colors stick very close to what the CFA uses with their bright red, black & white, to showcase our partnership with the CFA.

For the typography in this site, it's mainly using the typeface Pangram Sans which is a geometric sans-serif that is very legible especially at small screen sizes.

# Technical Overview

The languages used are HTML & CSS. 

This site aims to be responsive with the use of Flexbox, Grid, & media queries to allow for a better experience at mobile screen sizes.  

For the animations, I primarily used CSS pseudo classes to enhance the interactivity of the site.
